                <p>The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) was founded under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance (Cap. 480) in 1996 as an independent statutory body to implement the anti-discrimination ordinances in Hong Kong.

                    Throughout the last two decades, the equality landscape of Hong Kong has evolved significantly, as the society of Hong Kong progresses, and the aspirations and demands for equal opportunities among community members become stronger. Aptly, the anti-discrimination protection in Hong Kong has expanded accordingly, with the implementation of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance and the Disability Discrimination Ordinance (Cap. 487) in 1996, followed by the Family Status Discrimination Ordinance (Cap. 527) in 1997, and then the Race Discrimination Ordinance (Cap. 602) in 2009.
                    
                    Working along with different stakeholders and partners, the EOC strives to discharge its regulatory functions and promote greater understanding of equality in society through complaint investigation, conciliation and legal assistance, and through research, policy advocacy and public education. The EOC’s mission is to create a pluralistic and inclusive society free of discrimination where there is no barrier to equal opportunities.
                    
                    This site is meant to provide an information portal to the EOC’s milestones through the short span of the last 20 years, our anniversary programmes and vision for the future.
                    
                    As the EOC celebrates its 20th anniversary, the Commission will continue to play a crucial part in the developments of Hong Kong in the coming years. We look forward to working with you towards fostering an inclusive society in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
                    
                    Equal Opportunities Commission
