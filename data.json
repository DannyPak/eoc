As Hong Kong’s equality body, we also monitor relevant developments and act to promote equality for all, irrespective of different characteristics. Indeed, our overall vision is to create a pluralistic and inclusive society where there is no barrier to equal opportunities. <br><br>Over the last 20 years, the EOC has strived to break down the longstanding hurdles faced by various disadvantaged and marginalised groups in society. In fulfilling our role and mission, we have strived to keep pace with the development of Hong Kong, as the city underwent significant social, economic and political changes. <br><br>We are pleased to see that the concepts of equal opportunities are taking root in Hong Kong, and there is much greater understanding of their importance among community members. This could not have happened without the vision and effort of our predecessors, the dedication of the EOC colleagues, and the support of different stakeholders and sectors of the community. <br><br>The momentous occasion of the 20th anniversary offers us an opportunity to express our appreciation to our former Chairpersons, our current and past Board Members, as well as our allies and friends, to present our vision for the future, and renew our commitment to advancing equal opportunities for all. Building on the foundation of our work, we are eager to make even greater contribution to Hong Kong in the years to come.<br><br> We have created this mini-site to highlight the major milestones of the EOC to the public, as well as the events and programmes we have devised for this special occasion. We cordially invite you to join in our celebrations, and we look forward to having you in our future journey, as we continue to forge a path to an inclusive society free of discrimination.",
